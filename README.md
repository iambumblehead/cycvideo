While ES6 provides syntax for import/export, it currently *does nothing*,
anywhere, because the loader spec is not finished
( https://github.com/whatwg/loader ). ES6 Modules are not yet a thing; they do
not yet exist. !babel simply transpiles import/export to `require`, which is not
guaranteed to work once the loader is finished. Use CommonJS modules for now.
